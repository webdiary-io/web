From December 10, 2020 to January 10, 2021, DigitalOcean and Dev.to are running a Hackathon. The goal is to build real-world application with DigitalOcean's platform-as-a-service. This app can be anything from a personal site/portfolio to a "wacky app" that hasn't been seen before. [Announcing the DigitalOcean App Platform Hackathon on DEV!](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-digitalocean-app-platform-hackathon-on-dev-2i1k) I decide to join and try my skills in this too.

 I'm a huge fan of Digital Ocean. I came across this cloud provider four years ago, and loved them ever since. Easy to use services, short learning curves, polished UI, low and predictable prices. My only beef with them is long response time when it comes to tickets (2-3+ days). Luckily, the need for tickets is very low. Mostly, if you cannot find an answer or need to get a clarification regarding a charge or a service.

Overall, it is a perfect place for freelancers, and small to medium businesses that don't have time to manage their hardware.

For a while, I wanted to build an app to store my daily notes. As a developer I've written quite a few personal dev journals to keep notes of my day-to-day work and to help me to recall useful information about a project or a meeting. I'm of the "why remember something when it can be looked up" mindset. 

The problem is that handwritten journals are difficult to search. On which page did I have that design sketch? When was that meeting about a subject X ? This gets complicated when years go by.

So this project will be about building a Web Diary that simply allows me, and maybe you, to...
- write down quick notes and automatically date/time stamp them,
- attach tags, images, videos, links to these notes,
- search by keyword or tags,
- generate reports (could be useful for stand up, retrospectives, or just timesheets),
- all these secured in a private account


The technology that will be used 
- Digital Ocean Static and Custom Servers,
- Next.js and React for UI,
- Node.js for backend,
- Auth0.com for Authentication,
- MongoDb for data storage

I hope four weeks will be enough to accomplish this projects. I won't be able to work on it full time, therefore only the minimum required functionality will be implemented.

I'm not a front-end developer, so the MVP will be f.ugly :)

Wish me luck, and I hope something useful will come out of this.
